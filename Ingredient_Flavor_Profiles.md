## Implementation Notes

### Property Value Guidelines:
1. **Use 1-3 properties** per ingredient based on natural flavor and texture complexity
2. **Use the 0-10 scale** for consistency across both flavors and textures
3. **Consider preparation effects** - these values are for raw/unprepared ingredients
4. **Balance the system** - avoid having too many ingredients with the same dominant flavors/textures

### Property Distribution:
- **1 Property**: Simple ingredients (Water, Cilantro - 1 flavor + 1 texture)
- **2 Properties**: Moderate complexity (Shrimp, Squid, Cucumbers, Garlic, Peanuts, Seaweed - 2 flavors + 2 textures)
- **3 Properties**: Complex ingredients (BBQ Duck, Pork Floss, Century Egg, Kimchi - 3 flavors + 2 textures)

### Quantity Scaling Examples:
- **1 ingredient**: Values as listed above
- **2 ingredients**: Values × 2 (e.g., 2 BBQ Duck = 15.0 Umami, 8.0 Sweetness, 12.0 Saltiness, 13.0 Firm, 8.0 Chewy)
- **3 ingredients**: Values × 3 (e.g., 3 Kimchi = 21.0 Sourness, 15.0 Saltiness, 12.0 Umami, 16.5 Crunchy, 9.0 Watery)
- **5 ingredients**: Values × 5 (e.g., 5 Century Egg = 40.0 Umami, 20.0 Saltiness, 15.0 Bitterness, 30.0 Creamy, 22.5 Firm)

### Suggested Data Table Structure:
Each ingredient should have a `NaturalProperties` array with 2-6 `FIngredientProperty` entries (1-3 flavors + 1-3 textures), each containing:
- `PropertyType`: One of the five basic flavors OR five texture properties
- `Value`: Float value between 0.0 and 10.0
- `DisplayName`: User-friendly name for the property
- `Description`: Brief description of the flavor or texture characteristic

### Preparation Considerations:
- **Cooking methods** (boiling, baking, frying) can modify both flavor and texture base values
- **Seasoning and sauces** can add or enhance certain flavors
- **Texture changes** (softening, crisping, thickening) should be considered in preparation modifiers
- **Combination effects** should be considered when multiple ingredients are used together
